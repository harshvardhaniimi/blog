      <description>In a world driven by optimization, individuals are guided by nudges promoting beneficial choices and sludges creating barriers. Using examples from urban design, food choices, and media, I explore how these influences often prioritize convenience over genuine well-being, challenging you to critically assess what&amp;rsquo;s truly being optimized for in your lives.</description>

      <description>Instead of relying solely on previously published psychological research, I suggest conducting personal experiments on oneself to test and develop new behaviors and attitudes. Experimentation is a cheap and effective way to determine what works best for you, and it allows for personalised results that can be applied directly to one&amp;rsquo;s life.</description>

      <guid>/posts/population-collapse/</guid>
      <description>Population collapse is a theory that says if the growth rates continue to decline the way they are decreasing right now, we would reach population zero. It is a stage where the population neither grows, nor declines. That is, the number of births plus in-migrants equals the number of deaths plus out-migrants. While this may sound cheerful, you may not have considered the pitfalls yet.</description>

      <description>Life is short for learning from your own mistakes; you need to play catch-up with people who tried new things. Most people do not document their learnings. The rare culturati group that notes their understandings in an essay easily trumps the large group, which keeps their learnings to themselves.
I have read many interesting essays. Some of them stuck with me — like fingers working with super glue. I revisit them often.</description>

      <description>Bihar is one of the poorest states in India. Their over all literacy rate is 70% but there&amp;rsquo;s stark difference between girls (50%) and boys (70%). In 2007, the government decided to distribute bicycles to all girls for free in the hope to get higher school enrollment. The program was called Mukhyamantri Balika Cycle Yojna (Chief Minister&amp;rsquo;s Programme on Cycle for Girls). The program had astonishing improvements.</description>

Life is like a box of chocolates; there will be good things about every negative thing and bad about most positive things. I want to be happy, so I look at the positives.</description>

      <description>A problem with learning in public is keeping a strong note of how to avoid heresy. Back in the seventeenth century, if you said anything against God, even if the statement were true, you would be penalised. Sometimes it meant death. It didn&amp;rsquo;t matter if the statement was true. If you don&amp;rsquo;t believe me, just ask Galileo.</description>
