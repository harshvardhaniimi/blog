<p>(This is a formal write-up of my internship work. Read <a href="hp-blog-2023/">this blog</a> for a chirpy review of my internship!)</p>
<p>During my 15-month internship at HP Inc., I was actively engaged in implementing and optimizing machine learning forecasting models for over 18,000 products within HP Print.</p>
<p>Working with the SPaM team in supply chain modeling and machine learning, my responsibilities ranged from:
- Enhancing existing processes and understanding the codebase in my <a href="/hp22/">early days</a>.
- Advancing to more complex tasks such as leveling up machine learning components, integrating them into production, and pioneering SKU-level forecasting within the organization.
- Engaging in ML improvements like encoding categorical variables and feature engineering, which significantly boosted the model’s accuracy.
- Building an ETL pipeline to include channel partner inventory, sell-in, and sell-through volume, facilitating smoother data processing.</p>

<h3>Tools Used</h3>
<p>My work involved a multitude of tools and frameworks, vital to the execution of tasks, including:
- <strong>Python and Pandas</strong>: Primary language for modeling with LightGBM.
- <strong>SQL</strong>: Used in pipelines for data extraction and loading.
- <strong>Tableau</strong>: Dashboard for sharing results widely with all planners and forecasters.
- <strong>Terminal</strong>: Employed for various command-line operations. Learnt about symbolic links in particular, in addition to use of grep, find, move and more.
* <strong>LightGBM</strong>: A tree-based model used for forecasting.
* <strong>MLFlow</strong>: To track all our experiments, proving indispensable in managing numerous trials.</p>

<h3>Impacts</h3>
<p>My contributions led to notable impacts within the organization:
- The development of the first-ever SKU-level forecast with ML for Print at HP.
- Improved accuracy and efficiency of the forecasting model by introducing innovative changes.
- Created new pathways for new data by building an ETL pipeline, allowing for more effective demand forecasting.
- Successfully loaded the forecast into the Integrated Business Planning (IBP) tool, aiding planners across 18,000 SKUs and 45 geographies.
- I embraced the culture of innovation at HP, adhering to principles such as “Fail Fast” and actively participating in “Coding is Cool” sessions.</p>
<p>This experience has been an invaluable part of my professional growth, and I look forward to continuing my collaboration with the team while prioritizing my research in the coming year.</p>
