<p>Some friends of mine asked me how to make Indian curries. We Indians are
good at it; we make many types of Sabzi सब्ज़ी that non-Indians simply
call “curry”. Sabzi literally means vegetables. Today, I’m excited to
share a versatile curry recipe that’s perfect for anyone looking to
explore Indian cooking.</p>
<p>The recipe is a template or a base recipe. You can use it with any
vegetable of your preference or even Chicken (but cooking Chicken will
take longer to remember to adjust for that).</p>
<p>Also know that this is a home cooked curry, not something you would find
in an Indian restaurants. Thus, please don’t compare it with what you
see in Indian menu. Parts of it I learnt from watching my mother cook,
and rest from six years of cooking.</p>
<div id="the-heart-of-good-sabzi" class="section level2">
<h2>The Heart of Good Sabzi</h2>
<p>The beauty of Indian curry lies in its foundation — an aromatic base
for vegetables to be fried into, and then turned into the curry. The
vegetable (Sabzi) could be cauliflower (Gobi) resulting in Gobi Sabzi;
eggplant/brinjal (Baigan Sabzi); mushrooms (Mushroom Sabzi);
okra/ladyfingers (Bhindi Sabzi); or even a mixture of them (Mix Sabzi or
Mix Veg).</p>
<p>Let’s start with what you’ll need. Don’t worry if the ingredient list
seems long – most of these items can be found in your local grocery
store, and the rest are worth a special trip to an Indian market. Trust
me, your taste buds will thank you!</p>
<div id="your-shopping-list" class="section level3">
<h3>Your Shopping List</h3>
<p>For the aromatic base, gather:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>2-3 tablespoons of your preferred cooking oil<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></li>
<li>2 teaspoons each of cumin and mustard seeds</li>
<li>One large onion, finely chopped</li>
<li>4-5 cloves of garlic and half-thumb size of ginger, chopped (or a
tablespoon of ginger garlic paste)</li>
<li>Two medium tomatoes</li>
<li>Two medium potatoes</li>
<li>Fresh green chilies (adjust based on your spice tolerance, 1 for
low, 3-5 for high)</li>
<li>Fresh cilantro for that final touch</li>
<li>Salt to taste</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Masala (Spices)</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Turmeric (Haldi): Gives curry its signature golden color and has
anti-inflammatory properties</li>
<li>Garam Masala: A warming blend of ground spices, essential for most
Indian dishes</li>
<li>Red Chili Powder: Adds heat and color (start with less if you’re
sensitive to spice)</li>
</ol>
<p>Additionally, you should get some spice mix. Traditional homes don’t use
them but they’re necessary unless you know what proportion of ten
different spices to use every single time. MDH or Everest are good
brands for spice mix (found in Indian stores).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>MDH/Everest Sabzi Masala</strong>: Perfect for vegetable dishes</li>
<li><strong>Kitchen King by MDH:</strong> A versatile blend that enhances any curry’s
flavor</li>
</ul>
<p>Don’t feel restricted by the labels—you can use Biryani masala in
curry; off-label usage is okay. You can mix different masalas to create
your own unique flavor profiles.</p>
<p><strong>Recommended Combination</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>For basic curry: Turmeric + Garam Masala +Sabzi Masala</li>
<li>For extra flavor: Add Kitchen King to the basic combination</li>
<li>For heat lovers: Add extra red chili powder any combination</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember: Start with small amounts of masala and add more to taste - you
can always add, but you can’t subtract!</p>

<div id="choose-your-main-vegetables" class="section level2">
<h2>Choose Your Main Vegetable(s)</h2>
<p>You can use zero, one or multiple vegetables. Each vegetable has its own
taste. Using no vegetable would be Tamatar-Aloo Sabzi or (Tomato-Potato
Curry).</p>
<ul>
<li>Cauliflower: 1 medium head, cut into florets</li>
<li>Eggplant: 2 medium, cubed</li>
<li>Mixed vegetables: 2-3 cups of your choice</li>
<li>Mushrooms: 8-10 oz, quartered</li>
<li>Bell peppers: 1-2, chopped</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cooking Process</h3>
<ol start="9" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Monitor moisture levels:</li>
</ol>
<!-- -->
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>If too dry: Add small amounts of water (1/4 cup at a time)</li>
<li>If too wet: Cook uncovered until excess water evaporates</li>
</ol>
<!-- -->
<ol start="10" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Alternate between covered and uncovered cooking:</li>
</ol>
<!-- -->
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Cover to help vegetables release water and steam</li>
<li>Uncover to reduce liquid and intensify flavors</li>
</ol>
<!-- -->
<ol start="11" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Cook until vegetables reach desired tenderness (15-20 minutes).</li>
<li>Garnish with fresh cilantro.</li>

<div id="pro-tips" class="section level2">
<h2>Pro-Tips</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Spice Adjustment:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start with less spice; you can always add more. If you want to
add more spices after adding water to the curry, you can do that
in the Tadka (described below) or heating the spices first in
some oil.</li>
<li>Taste frequently and adjust seasonings. You will get better with
time.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Tadka (Final Flavor Boost):</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Heat 2 tablespoons ghee or oil in a small pan</p></li>
<li><p>Add 2-3 dried red chilies</p></li>
<li><p>Add 1 teaspoon cumin seeds</p></li>
<li><p>Add 1/2 teaspoon red chili powder</p></li>
<li><p>When spices sputter, pour over finished curry</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="consistency-in-curry-thickness" class="section level2">
<h2>Consistency in Curry Thickness</h2>
<p>Different people have different preferences in the dryness of their
curry. Some like dry curries (good for eating with bread) while others
like watery curry (good with rice).</p>
<ul>
<li>For dry curry: Use minimal water and cook uncovered</li>
<li>For gravy: Add more water and simmer covered</li>
<li>Ideal consistency: Vegetables should be well-coated with thick gravy</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="final-remarks-and-troubleshooting-tips" class="section level2">
<h2>Final Remarks and Troubleshooting Tips</h2>
<p>As long as you follow the basic recipe, there is very less chance of
getting something wrong. But remember, it is okay to make mistakes and
its likely you will make mistakes. But those mistakes will teach you how
to cook better.</p>
<p>The most important ingredient in cooking is time. Remember not to hurry
or be too late. Some people hurry up in adding water before the veggies
are well fried in spices. Some delay in stirring and the vegetable burns
and sticks to the bottom. In that case, add some water and then stir
instead of stirring dry.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>Different cooking oil have slightly different taste. If you are
unsure, choose refined vegetable oil. Don’t use seseme seed oil.
Mustard oil will have a strong smell. You can use butter or ghee but
you may need a lot; I’ll recommend pairing up with some oil if you
use butter or ghee.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
