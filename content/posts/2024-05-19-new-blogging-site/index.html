<p>I have some exciting news: I’ve moved my blogs from www.harsh17.in/blog to blog.harsh17.in. This change aims to keep my blogs separate from the rest of the information on my site.</p>
<p>Hugo Apero, the theme I use for my online home, has a beautiful organization. However, once I had more than 20 blogs, the list started to look cluttered. As I am going to start looking for jobs soon, I wanted my “personal” and “professional” websites to look slightly different. Additionally, I wanted the experience of managing another website.</p>
<p>With these goals in mind, I created a new Hugo site, managed through R Blogdown. I love Blogdown for its simplicity and flexibility:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ease of setup:</strong> Quickly get a site up and running.</li>
<li><strong>Markdown support:</strong> Write posts in Markdown.</li>
<li><strong>Integration:</strong> Seamlessly integrates with R and RStudio.</li>
<li><strong>Customization:</strong> Easily customizable themes and layouts.</li>
</ul>
<p>The theme I’m using for the new site is called Hugo Archie (<a href="https://github.com/athul/archie" class="uri">https://github.com/athul/archie</a>). I’ve streamlined it by including only the front page, a page listing all blogs, and a page with tags. Plain and simple, right?</p>
<p>Please note that the old URLs might not work. You will need to replace <code>www</code> with <code>blog</code> in the link. For example, <a href="www.harsh17.in/languages/">www.harsh17.in/languages/</a> becomes <a href="https://blog.harsh17.in/languages/" class="uri">https://blog.harsh17.in/languages/</a>.</p>
<p>As always, feel free to email me if you find my blog useful. You can also sign my guestbook here: <a href="https://users3.smartgb.com/g/g.php?a=s&amp;i=g36-36168-7b">Guestbook</a>.</p>
