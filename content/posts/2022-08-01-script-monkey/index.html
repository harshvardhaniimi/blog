<p>Recently, I learned a neat trick during my internship at HP.</p>
<p>Sometimes you only need a few changes in the existing script before rerunning it all. For example, while working on a periodically executed project, we needed to run the same set of Jupiter notebooks every month. The code didn’t change, barring a few parameters.</p>
<p>Usually, I recommend keeping the parameters at the beginning, so you notice what you need to change readily. But sometimes, you cannot avoid changes midway through the script.</p>
<p>How do you identify all the changes you need manually before hitting “restart kernel and run all” (in Jupyter Notebooks) or “Source” (in RStudio)?</p>
<div id="hi-monkey" class="section level1">
<h1>Hi Monkey 🐵</h1>
<p>Use a Script Monkey in your codebase at all locations where you need to change things manually. All that involves is writing an additional comment saying “Script Monkey”. Later, search for all monkeys in the script and make the changes. Simple.</p>
<pre class="python"><code># Script monkey: Add current month and lag
df = pd.DataFrame(month = [&#39;2022-02&#39;, &#39;2022-03&#39;, &#39;2022-03&#39;], 
                  lag = [1, 2, 3])</code></pre>
<p>Adding a small comment with #Script Monkey will save you hours looking through the codes. Just Cmd + F (⌘ + F in Mac or Ctrl + F in Windows) for “monkey”, and you will know what to keep track of!</p>

<div id="beyond-scripts" class="section level1">
<h1>Beyond Scripts</h1>
<p>Scripts are only the beginning. Later on, you might need to modify more things. In that case, use Data Monkey, Tuning Monkey, Timing Monkey – and more!</p>
<div id="data-monkey" class="section level2">
<h2>Data Monkey 🐵</h2>
<p>In data analytics or machine learning projects, data modifications are inevitable as new data streams in or data structures evolve.</p>
<pre class="python"><code># Data monkey: Update data source
data = pd.read_csv(&#39;new_data_source.csv&#39;)

# Data monkey: Add new features
data[&#39;new_feature&#39;] = data[&#39;existing_feature1&#39;] * data[&#39;existing_feature2&#39;]</code></pre>
<p>Utilize “Data Monkey” comments to mark places where data sources or features may need updates. A quick search for “Data Monkey” will guide you to all data-related modifications at once.</p>
</div>
<div id="tuning-monkey" class="section level2">
<h2>Tuning Monkey 🐵</h2>
<p>Parameter tuning is crucial for optimizing model performance.</p>
<pre class="python"><code># Tuning monkey: Update hyperparameters
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, max_depth=5)</code></pre>
<p>By marking parameter tuning sections with “Tuning Monkey,” you can swiftly locate and adjust model parameters, streamlining the tuning process.</p>
</div>
<div id="timing-monkey" class="section level2">
<h2>Timing Monkey 🐵</h2>
<p>Project timelines often shift, impacting deadlines and schedules.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Timing monkey: Update project month
project_month = &#39;2023-11-01&#39;</code></pre>
<p>Employ “Timing Monkey” comments to highlight date or time-sensitive code segments, aiding in keeping project timelines accurate and up-to-date.</p>
<p>Each Monkey variant simplifies managing different project elements, helping maintain a clean, organized, and efficient workflow.</p>
