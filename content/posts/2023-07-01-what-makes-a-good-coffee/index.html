<p>Ever since I began chronicling my coffee journey, things have become intriguingly more flavorful. â˜•</p>
<p>The roots of a coffee bean can dictate much of its taste profile. For instance, single-origin coffee, where beans are sourced solely from one region, usually outshines blends, which mix beans from multiple origins.</p>
<p>The environment in which coffee grows, specifically the soil and climate, further impacts its flavor. African coffee, primarily from Kenya ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡ª, Ethiopia ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¹, and Rwanda ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡¼, offers a delightful fruity sweetness. Conversely, South American beans (primarily from Colombia ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡´ and Brazil ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·) impart a nutty, caramel-like note. As for Asian varieties (from Indonesia ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡©, Vietnam ðŸ‡»ðŸ‡³, India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³), they bear a subtle spice kick, which explains the scarcity of such origins in American cafes.</p>
<p>My favourite beans so far have been <a href="https://bluetokaicoffee.com/products/attikan?variant=40088519901239">Blue Tokaiâ€™s Attikan Estate</a> (grown in Biligiriranga Hills in Karnataka ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³), <a href="https://atomicroastery.com/products/black-velvet">Atomic Coffee Roastersâ€™ Black Velvet</a> (grown in Honduras &amp; Guatemala), and Gimme!

<p>Coffee beans Iâ€™ve tried so far. <a href="https://bluetokaicoffee.com/products/attikan?variant=40088519901239">Blue Tokaiâ€™s Attikan Estate</a> (grown in Biligiriranga Hills in Karnataka ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³), <a href="https://atomicroastery.com/products/black-velvet">Atomic Coffee Roastersâ€™ Black Velvet</a> (grown in Honduras &amp; Guatemala), and Gimme! Coffeeâ€™s <a href="https://gimmecoffee.com/eternal-flame-fairtrade/">Eternal Flame</a> have been my favourite. Starbucks mustâ€™ve used additional flavours or syrups as their beans neither smelled good, nor tasted good. (Not all <a href="https://www.harsh17.in/seattle/#starbucks-reserve">Starbucks</a> are bad though.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The roasting process also plays a crucial role in shaping coffeeâ€™s taste. Coffee seeds are inherently bitter, and roasting mellows this bitterness, unveiling the true flavors. Hence, light roasts are often more bitter than dark roasts, a fact contrary to common belief.</p>
<p>Given the profound influence of beans, their freshness significantly affects the overall experience. Freshly roasted beans boast a robust aroma and taste compared to month-old ones, like those you might encounter at Starbucks. Typically, high-quality beans retain their taste for two weeks, or up to four weeks when stored in an airtight container. While some people resort to refrigeration for longevity, Iâ€™ve not found substantial differences.</p>
<p>Then comes the pivotal step that Baristas are celebrated forâ€”brewing. There exist at least ten diverse brewing methods.</p>
<p><img src="images/6df9d195-5cfa-4468-9160-085b89c7959d.png" /></p>
<p>My experiments have led me to the Moka pot, French Press, Drip coffee (pour over), and Aeropress. (The latter two didnâ€™t make it to the meme.) As a Latte aficionado, Aeropress resonates best with me. Using the Moka pot has also been fun, although it stayed back at my motherâ€™s place in India after my visit last December.</p>
<p>However, none of these methods can produce a satisfactory espresso shot. For that, one either needs to invest in a dedicated espresso machine or visit a decent cafe (not Starbucks; their beans were are a deal-breaker).</p>
<p>Finally, the brewing technique, as emphasized by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMb0O2CdPBNi-QqPk5T3gsQ">James Hoffman</a>, is paramount. Iâ€™m still honing this step, so stay tuned for more!</p>
