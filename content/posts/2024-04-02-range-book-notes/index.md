The following are my notes from the Book [Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World by David Epstein](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41795733-range).

1. **The cult of the head start:** Early specialization is not the only path to success. It is not even the best path to success. Early specialization works for some but not for most. The most successful people are those who have a range of experiences and skills. They are generalists, not specialists.
2. **Polgar Sisters:** The Polgár sisters - Judit, Susan, and Sofia - are renowned as some of the strongest chess players in the world. Their father, László Polgár, was a psychologist who believed that "geniuses are made, not born" and that early training and specialization were key. Along with his wife, Klara, he decided to test his theory by raising his children to be chess prodigies. The experiment was a huge success. Susan Polgár was the first woman to earn the Grandmaster title in 1991, at age 22. Judit Polgár became the youngest person ever to achieve the Grandmaster title in 1991, at age 15, breaking Bobby Fischer's previous record by a month. All three sisters have been ranked among the top players in the world at various times.
3. **Tiger Woods:** Tiger Woods is often held up as an example of the benefits of early specialization. He started playing golf at the age of two and was a prodigy from the start. He won the Under-10 tournament at the age of four. He won his first major tournament at the age of 21 and went on to become one of the greatest golfers of all time.
4. **Roger Federer:** Roger Federer is often held up as an example of the benefits of late specialization. He played a variety of sports as a child, including soccer, basketball, and badminton, before settling on tennis. He did not start playing tennis seriously until the age of 12. He won his first major tournament at the age of 21 and went on to become one of the greatest tennis players of all time. At the age of 30 when most tennis players have retired, he was still winning major tournaments.
5. **Kind vs Wicked Learning Environments:** One explanation why some fields have child prodigies while others do not is that some fields have a "kind" learning environment while others have a "wicked" learning environment. In a kind learning environment, the rules are clear, the goals are stable, and the feedback is immediate and informative. In a wicked learning environment, the rules are unclear, the goals are constantly changing, and the feedback is delayed or nonexistent. Fields with kind learning environments tend to produce child prodigies, while fields with wicked learning environments tend to produce late bloomers.
6. **Tactical vs Strategic Knowledge:** Kind learning environments value tactical knowledge and repository of facts. Wicked learning environments value strategic knowledge and the ability to think critically and creatively. Kind learning environments are best suited to specialists, while wicked learning environments are best suited to generalists.
7. **Examples of Kind Learning Environments:** Chess, classical music, mathematics, and computer programming are examples of fields with kind learning environments. They have clear rules, stable goals, and immediate and informative feedback. They tend to produce child prodigies.
8. **Examples of Wicked Learning Environments:** Science, art, politics, and business are examples of fields with wicked learning environments. They have unclear rules, constantly changing goals, and delayed or nonexistent feedback. They tend to produce late bloomers.
