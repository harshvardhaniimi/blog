The following are my notes from the Book [Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World by David Epstein](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41795733-range). In today's hyper-specialized world, it might seem counterintuitive that broadening one's experiences and delaying specialization could lead to greater success. However, David Epstein provides compelling evidence and stories to support the idea that being a generalist in a specialized world is not just advantageous; it's crucial.

Here are some of my key takeaways from the book:

### The cult of the head start

Early specialization is not the only path to success. It is not even the best path to success. Early specialization works for some but not for most. The most successful people are those who have a range of experiences and skills. They are generalists, not specialists.

### Polgar Sisters

The Polgár sisters - Judit, Susan, and Sofia - are renowned as some of the strongest chess players in the world. Their father, László Polgár, was a psychologist who believed that "geniuses are made, not born" and that early training and specialization were key. Along with his wife, Klara, he decided to test his theory by raising his children to be chess prodigies. The experiment was a huge success. Susan Polgár was the first woman to earn the Grandmaster title in 1991, at age 22. Judit Polgár became the youngest person ever to achieve the Grandmaster title in 1991, at age 15, breaking Bobby Fischer's previous record by a month. All three sisters have been ranked among the top players in the world at various times.

### **Tiger Woods: Child Prodigy**

Tiger Woods is often held up as an example of the benefits of early specialization. He started playing golf at the age of two and was a prodigy from the start. He won the Under-10 tournament at the age of four. He won his first major tournament at the age of 21 and went on to become one of the greatest golfers of all time.

### **Roger Federer: Generalist**

Roger Federer is often held up as an example of the benefits of late specialization. He played a variety of sports as a child, including soccer, basketball, and badminton, before settling on tennis. He did not start playing tennis seriously until the age of 12. He won his first major tournament at the age of 21 and went on to become one of the greatest tennis players of all time. At the age of 30 when most tennis players have retired, he was still winning major tournaments.

### **Success Depends on Learning Environment: Kind vs Wicked Learning Environments**

One explanation why some fields have child prodigies while others do not is that some fields have a "kind" learning environment while others have a "wicked" learning environment. In a kind learning environment, the rules are clear, the goals are stable, and the feedback is immediate and informative.

In a wicked learning environment, the rules are unclear, the goals are constantly changing, and the feedback is delayed or nonexistent. Fields with kind learning environments tend to produce child prodigies, while fields with wicked learning environments tend to produce late bloomers.

### **Repository of Facts vs Learning: Tactical vs Strategic Knowledge**

Kind learning environments value tactical knowledge and repository of facts. Wicked learning environments value strategic knowledge and the ability to think critically and creatively. Kind learning environments are best suited to specialists, while wicked learning environments are best suited to generalists.

### **School and Exams are Examples of Kind Learning Environments**

Chess, classical music, mathematics, and computer programming are examples of fields with kind learning environments. They have clear rules, stable goals, and immediate and informative feedback. They tend to produce child prodigies because years of training leads to development of huge tactical knowledge.

One study found that chess grandmasters were very good at remembering the positions of chess pieces, often with just seconds of seeing it. They were shown a chess game in progress and ask to recall, and many did it with perfect accuracy. However, when they were shown a random assortment of chess pieces on the board --- an arrangement that'd never occur in an actual game --- they were no better than an average human.

They didn't have photographic memory but had learnt the "tricks of trade" with years of practice.

### **Examples of Wicked Learning Environments**

Science, art, politics, and business are examples of fields with wicked learning environments. They have unclear rules, constantly changing goals, and delayed or nonexistent feedback. They tend to produce late bloomers.

Nobel prize winning scientists tend to have hobbies that they care about, often completely unrelated to their area of expertise. Other scientists? Usually not.

It helps to learn many subjects at once because our brain can draw connections between many topics together.

### Implications for Artificial Intelligence

Machines are very good at achieving one task, but one task alone. However, as soon as the task changes, they struggle to perform well. A computer program was taught to play a strategy computer game --- only taught the rules, not the strategy. With many, many tries, the program figured out how to beat virtually every human online. Why? Because, it could factor the potential strategies following its own gameplay, while making its first gameplay, much faster and with higher accuracy than a human.

However, as soon a similar tool was provided to the human players (which only showed potential next step of the computer after the human's gameplay), the computer program lost all its advantage. A simple computer + human beat an advanced machine hitherto unchallenged.

To me, this shows how AI with humans will result in human progress so much better and faster than AI. That's why AI-doomerism isn't healthy.

### Conclusion

Like many non-fiction books, this was a little too long. I believe the book could've been much shorter, perhaps a phamphlet. However, the key idea that we should expand our knowledge base so that we can draw inspiration from multiple sectors was novel and good to hear. Feel free to skip chapters; I don't think you'll lose the overall message.

### Free Audiobooks

I was listening to this book using [Libby](https://libbyapp.com/) which provides free audiobooks, courtesy your local library. Audiobooks are great way to kill time productively and learn more. It is very likely that your local library might already provide you a connection for free. Just so you know, I'm a member of [Knoxville Public Library](https://www.knoxcountylibrary.org/) but I wasn't paid to write this.
