<p>I am trapped inside Apple’s beautiful garden.
It is beautiful, but it is locked.</p>
<p>Why is it locked?</p>
<p>I have an iPhone.</p>
<p>And an Apple Watch.</p>
<p>And Apple Card.</p>
<p>And Airpods.</p>
<p>And Homepods — two of them actually — which have 10/10 spatial audio.</p>
<p>And an iPad — with Apple Pencil — that I hardly use.</p>
<p>And, of course, my Macbook Air.</p>
<p>Now, imagine I want to try an android phone.</p>
<p>Oops, the watch doesn’t work anymore.</p>
<p>Oops, my credit score just hit rock bottom due to closing a high value credit card.</p>
<p>Oops, the Airpods are classic bluetooth earbuds with critically battery.</p>
<p>Oops, the homepods are useless.</p>
<p>From a $1000 expense to buy a new phone, now it is almost $3000 to replace phone, earbuds, and speakers.</p>
<p>I still need to decide what to do with my existing devices.</p>
<p>Sell them?
Donate them?</p>
<p>Apple will only give me credit for buying more from Apple.</p>
<p>What about the iPad?</p>
<p>Yeah that’s pretty independent.</p>
<p>I can totally move to a Surface Pro or Samsung Note.</p>
<p>Except then I’ve to decide what to do with $150 Apple Pencil and $250 keyboard, which will be useless without iPad.</p>
<p>My Mac seems to be the only one that can exist independently.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Probably because its foundation were laid before Apple became an ecosystem company.</p>
<p>Before it locked me in its beautiful garden.</p>
<p>I had come to take a stroll around the fountain of Macbook.
Now, I’m stuck in the quicksand of Apple.</p>
<p>Which, I reiterate, is beautiful.
But I’m not sure I want to be stuck here.</p>
<p>I value my freedom.</p>
