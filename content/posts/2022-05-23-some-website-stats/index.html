<p>Here are some interesting stats about my website. I would probably do this every year in the last week of May.</p>
<p><strong>All of these stats are for last three months, except the last one. The number of users is from 2019 to 2022.</strong></p>
<div id="i-had-542-visitors-and-i-was-meeting-491-of-them-for-the-first-time." class="section level1">
<h1>I had 542 visitors and I was meeting 491 of them for the first time.</h1>
<p><img src="images/Screen%20Shot%202022-05-23%20at%2012.52.48%20AM.png" /></p>
<p>This is encouraging to know. This means my website is gaining audience rapidly. They also visited four pages on average.</p>
</div>
<div id="most-visitors-were-from-us-almost-40" class="section level1">
<h1>Most visitors were from US, almost 40%</h1>
<p><img src="images/Screen%20Shot%202022-05-23%20at%2012.54.18%20AM.png" /></p>
<p>Second most number of visitors were from India. Germany as third is surprising.</p>
<p><img src="images/Screen%20Shot%202022-05-23%20at%201.17.44%20AM.png" /></p>
</div>
<div id="wheres-ashburn" class="section level1">
<h1>Where’s Ashburn?</h1>
<p><img src="images/Screen%20Shot%202022-05-23%20at%2012.57.21%20AM.png" /></p>
<p>Most visitors are from Ashburn. Where is that? Ashburn, Virginia? Ashburn, Georgia? And why are people from Ashburn so interested in my website. I’m curious…</p>
</div>
<div id="surprise-surprise-chrome-is-the-most-popular-browser" class="section level1">
<h1>Surprise, surprise: Chrome is the most popular browser</h1>
<p><img src="images/Screen%20Shot%202022-05-23%20at%201.00.26%20AM.png" /></p>
<p>Safari is second. (I love Safari, especially how beautiful it is. I do wish it handled extensions better to be honest.)</p>
</div>
<div id="referral-is-getting-me-most-visitors" class="section level1">
<h1>Referral is getting me most visitors</h1>
<p><img src="images/Screen%20Shot%202022-05-23%20at%201.05.47%20AM.png" /></p>
<p>My email signature is not that helpful, I guess. Organic search is great; Google’s actually ranking me high enough to have an impact — at least in some cases. The big daddy of all are Referrals. I want to see who are referring visitors to my website.</p>
<p><img src="images/Screen%20Shot%202022-05-23%20at%201.08.55%20AM.png" /></p>
<p>Practically, this is <a href="https://www.r-bloggers.com">r-bloggers.com</a> alone.</p>
</div>
<div id="surprisingly-my-hindi-blogpost-is-the-most-visited-one-in-last-one-month" class="section level1">
<h1>Surprisingly, my Hindi blogpost is the most visited one in last one month</h1>
<p><img src="images/Screen%20Shot%202022-05-23%20at%201.20.02%20AM.png" /></p>
</div>
<div id="the-number-of-users-has-consistently-increased-over-time" class="section level1">
<h1>The number of users has consistently increased over time</h1>
<p><img src="images/Screen%20Shot%202022-05-23%20at%201.23.55%20AM.png" /></p>
</div>
